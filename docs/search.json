    "text": "My Dog\nI have a Shiba Inu named Henji. He’s currently ten years old. I remember really wanting to have a dog when I was younger as I was the only child in the family. He loves to sleep and watch us eat food all the time. Even though he is very stubborn and does not listen well at all, he’s been a blessing to our family. Because of him, we would go walk around the neighborhood much more often. That actually led us to meeting our neighbors and getting to know them much better. I’m very thankful to have Henji in my life as a lifelong companion. Here are some photos of him :)\n  \n\n\nTaiwan\nMy family is from Taiwan, so we try to go back at least once a year. The vast majority of my relatives still live in Taiwan, and it’s always great to reconnect with them once a year. I love the vibes of the cities, the pubic transport, the culture, and the food in Taiwan. The feel is just different from the US and unique in its own good way. It’s definitely the home away from home for me. The family and food are definitely the things that I miss the most when I come back home. I would recommend visiting in the winter though, as the summer can be very hot and humid.\n  \n\n\nMy Hometown\nMy hometown is in Tustin, a suburb in Orange County. It borders Irvine, Santa Ana, and Orange. I have lived here for most of my life. It’s a safe city with an old town district that’s pretty unique. The weather is good year round and it’s not too far from LA either. The city has a good variety of food, from asian, american, and mexican cuisine. There’s a lot of parks and greenery in the city. I attached a map of food spots to check out in Tustin if you ever find yourself down there."

    "text": "NBA Finals\n\n\nPacers Vs. Thunder\nI have been a huge basketball fan my whole life, a lifelong Lakers fan too, just throwing it out there. So if you told me that this year’s finals would feature the OKC Thunder vs. the Indiana Pacers, I would have said that you were crazy. The Thunder part I wouldn’t be too surprised. They were one of the top teams in the Western Conference last year. The Pacers on the other hand was a complete shocker. I expected either last year’s finals winner Celtics or the red hot Cavs to make it the finals. Injuries made both of these teams a lot less formidable. The Pacer’s quick pace and relentless effort allowed them to take down the gritty New York Knicks. The series is currently tied 1-1, so we’ll have to see what happens next. This will definitely be a great series for the books.\n\n\nWhat the Hellyburton?\nTyrese Haliburton has been the finisher for the Pacers this playoffs this season. He hasn’t the most points in the games, that would go to Pascal Siakam, but Hali has created some of the most memorable playoff memories in recent times. He has hit not one, not two, not three, but four game winning shots in different games of different series. Some call it witchcraft, I think this is just amazing basketball.\n\n\n\nMVP Shai\nThe other main piece on the opposing team is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Known as SGA for short, he earned the MVP on effortless shot making and efficient scoring. He has averaged 30 points this season and is looking to get another piece of the hardware at the end of the season. With a stacked crew of stars for teammates, SGA has great support to help him even if his shots do not fall."
